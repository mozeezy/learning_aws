## Day01 - What is Cloud Computing

#### Definition
- Cloud computing is the ability to access various IT services on demand on a pay-as-you-go basis.
- What are these IT services?
  - Things like creating servers, storing and analyzing data, creating and managing networks, and much more.

#### Scenario
- Imaging you're developing a web application on your machine and you're excited to share it with the world so you chose to create a public IP address associated with your application.
- Obviously, this means that you must leave the server (i.e. your machine) running to be able to handle the incoming traffic from users on your website.
- But what if the traffic is too much for your machine to handle?
- Maybe you decided to build a physical server (i.e. a large computer with huge computing powers) to handle traffic and user data.
- Now, what if your application had even more users than your first server can handle? 
- You think that it's time to buy another one. 
- So now you have two server machines.
- What if traffic dies down? Now you have an extra server machine that is not even being used.

#### Analysis of the scenario
- From the scenario above, this was how companies used to handle their IT operations; by having machines and servers that would handle IT operations ON-PREMISE.
- This can have several challenges.
  - The need for a large physical space to hold these computers (i.e. data centers).
  - The need to have a dedicated team for maintenance.
  - It makes it hard for a company to scale up or down.

#### Enter the Cloud
- The cloud is essentially a virtual data center that has many servers used for different IT purposes.
- These servers provide various on-demand services and are maintained by cloud providers (i.e. AWS). This eliminates the need for companies to invest huge amounts of capital and expertise into building and maintaining physical servers.
- A huge benefit of the cloud is that it allows for companies to scale up or down as they please, since cloud services follow the pay-as-you-go model.
  - This means that you only pay for what you need and use.

#### Cloud Delivery Models
1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  - In this model, the cloud providers only provide the data center while allowing users the flexibility of having their own operating systems, application, and security.

2. Platform as a service (PaaS)
  - In this model, the cloud providers provide the data center as well as the operating systems and allows the user to focus on application development.

3. Software as a service (SaaS)
  - In this model, the cloud providers provide everything. The only thing users are responsible for is who can access these applications and managing the underlying software.
